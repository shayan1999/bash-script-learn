to make bash scripts runable with ./name.sh 
run chmod +x name.sh

otherwise you can run it with bash name.sh

some of the bashes need some dependencies installed in your terminal 
I think it's only the only dependecy is jq in manageResponse.sh but beaware that
it can cause the errors you see when you run these bashes

last thing I have to mention is that I wrote these bashes with mac os system and 
sometimes some of the commands are different in different os and it can cause problems
so dont become upset if you faced any problem and feel free to send texts to me
